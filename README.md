## 🛠 Introduction

One of the key components of DeFi is the use of smart contracts, self-executing agreements that are stored on a blockchain. In this article, we'll explore the role of smart contracts in DeFi on the Celo blockchain, and show you how to develop and deploy a smart contract on the Celo network.

Celo's EVM compatibility is one of its most significant advantages of using Celo Network, as it enables developers to easily migrate their dapps from the Ethereum blockchain to Celo with minimal code modifications (if any) and a simple configuration file change. This article will demonstrate how to accomplish this task by creating a sample smart contract project and deploying on the Celo Network. While a comprehensive article of creation of a sample Dapp projects is beyond the scope of this article, it is not limited to the project here alone. However, this article can be used as a general reference for deploying any Ethereum-based project and more on the Celo blockchain.

The aim of this article is to guide developers who have previously deployed dapps on the Ethereum blockchain or otherwise in replicating the process on the Celo blockchain. Additionally, this tutorial is also suitable for first timers who wish to learn how to deploy dapps on Celo.

## 🛠 What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing agreement that is stored on a blockchain. It contains code that defines the rules and regulations for a particular transaction or agreement. When certain conditions are met, the contract automatically executes, triggering the transfer of funds, the exchange of assets, or the completion of another action.

Smart contracts are particularly useful in DeFi because they can eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency. They can be used to create a range of financial products, including lending and borrowing platforms, decentralized exchanges, and insurance contracts.

<br><br>

## 🛠 The Role of Smart Contracts in DeFi on Celo

Celo is a mobile-first blockchain platform that is designed to be fast, scalable, and secure. It uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which allows for high throughput and low transaction fees. Celo also supports the creation and deployment of smart contracts, which are essential to the development of DeFi on the platform.

Smart contracts on Celo are written in Solidity, a programming language that is used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that developers who are familiar with Ethereum smart contracts will find it easy to develop on Celo. Celo also provides a range of developer tools, including a command-line interface (CLI) and a web-based IDE, to simplify the development and deployment of smart contracts.
<br><br>

## 🛠 Developing and Deploying a Smart Contract on Celo

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain network. They are used to automate the execution of agreements and transactions in a transparent and secure way. Celo is a blockchain platform that allows developers to deploy and execute smart contracts. In this blog post, we will discuss how to develop and deploy a smart contract on Celo using Solidity code samples.

**Step 1: Set up your development environment**<br>
To develop and deploy a smart contract on Celo, you will need to have a development environment set up. This will typically involve installing the necessary tools and dependencies, such as Node.js and the Celo CLI. You will also need to set up an account on the Celo network and obtain some testnet CELO and cUSD tokens for testing purposes.

Start by cloning your personal repo or follow up and create a sample project like we have below

```js

  git clone <your-repo-link-here>

```

After cloning or creating a repository, then we definitely have all the contracts required to deploy a Dapp.
Let's install all the dependencies of the dapp by using

```js

  npm install

```

**Step 2: Using CELO CLI**<br>
Initially, we must identify a means to engage with the Celo blockchain. In the context of this article, we will utilize the Celo CLI to achieve this objective.

```js

 npm install -g @celo/celocli

```

CeloCLI offers a straightforward approach for interacting with the Celo blockchain and proves to be a valuable asset for all Celo developers. Additional details about CeloCLI can be obtained ([here](https://docs.celo.org/developer#quickstart)).


**Step 3: Developing your Smart Contract**<br>

Solidity is a programming language used to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Celo is compatible with Ethereum, which means you can use Solidity to develop smart contracts on Celo as well. Here is an example of a simple Solidity smart contract:

```js

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}

```

Yeah, Give it a chill. Lets me explain each line of code above, It's okay to skip this part is you fully understand what's going on.

```js

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

```

This line specifies the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used to compile the smart contract. In this case, it is specifying version 0.8.0 or higher.

```js

contract SimpleStorage {

```

This line begins the definition of a new smart contract named "SimpleStorage". The contract is defined using the `contract` keyword, followed by the contract name.

```js

uint256 storedData;

```

This line declares a state variable called `storedData`, which is of type `uint256`. This variable will hold the value that is stored by the smart contract.

```js

function set(uint256 x) public {
    storedData = x;
}

```

This is a function called `set` that takes a parameter of type `uint256` called `x`. This function sets the value of `storedData` to the value of `x`. The `public` keyword makes the function accessible to anyone on the blockchain.

```js

function get() public view returns (uint256) {
    return storedData;
}

```

This is a function called `get` that returns the value of `storedData`. The `public` and `view` keywords indicate that this function can be called by anyone and that it does not modify the state of the contract. The returns keyword specifies the type of the `return` value, which in this case is `uint256`.



This smart contract is a simple storage contract that allows you to set and get a value. The `set` function sets the value of `storedData`, while the `get` function returns the value of `storedData`.


**Step 4: Deploying your Smart Contract on Celo**<br>
To deploy a smart contract on Celo, you need to follow these steps:

- Make sure your Celo CLI is installed: Celo CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with the Celo blockchain. You can install it using NPM by running the following command like we did on setup

- Create a Celo account: You need to create a Celo account to deploy a smart contract on Celo. You can create a Celo account using the `celocli account:create` command.

```js

celocli account:create

```

- Fund your Celo account: To deploy a smart contract on Celo, you need to have Celo tokens in your account. You can use the `celocli account:balance` command to check your account balance. If your balance is low, you can use the Celo faucet to get some free Celo tokens.

- Compile your smart contract: You need to compile your Solidity smart contract before you can deploy it on Celo. You can use the `solc` compiler to compile your contract code.

```js

solc SimpleStorage.sol --bin --abi --optimize -o build/

```

- Deploy your smart contract: Once you have compiled your smart contract, you can use the `celocli contract:deploy` command to deploy it on Celo.

```js

celocli contract:deploy --contract-name SimpleStorage --from <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --args "arg1,arg2" --gas 2000000

```

In this command, `SimpleStorage` is the name of your Solidity smart contract, and `<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` is your Celo account address. You also need to provide any arguments required by your contract using the `--args` flag.

**Testing Your Smart Contract:**<br>

Once you have deployed your smart contract on Celo, you can test it using the celocli `contract:call command`. This command allows you to call functions in your smart contract and get the results.

```js

celocli contract:call --to <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --data <FUNCTION_CALL_DATA>

```

In this command, `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` is the address of your deployed smart contract, and `<FUNCTION_CALL_DATA>` is the data required to call a specific function in your contract.

That's a break! Developing and deploying smart contracts on Celo is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can develop and deploy your own smart contracts on Celo.
<br><br>

- ## Modifying the truffle config file for deploy

Note, If you don't modify the truffle-config.js file to be compatible with the Celo blockchain, you may encounter errors or issues when trying to deploy your smart contract. So it is important to make these modifications before deploying your smart contract to the Celo blockchain.

To modify the truffle-config.js file to be compatible with the Celo blockchain, you can follow these steps:

**Install the Celo provider for Truffle:**<br>

```js

npm install @celo/ethers-wrapper @celo/truffle-provider

```

Open the `truffle-config.js` file in your project directory.
Add the following code to the top of the file to import the Celo provider and ethers library:

```js

const CeloProvider = require('@celo/truffle-provider');
const { ethers } = require('@celo/ethers-wrapper');

```

Find the `networks` object in the `truffle-config.js` file. This object contains the configuration settings for each network that you want to deploy your smart contract on.

Add a new network object for Celo, as shown below:

```js

celo: {
  provider: () => new CeloProvider(),
  network_id: 42220,
  gas: 5000000,
  gasPrice: 1000000000, // 1 gwei (in wei)
  timeoutBlocks: 200,
  skipDryRun: true,
}

```

**Here, we're specifying the following options:**<br>

- `provider`: This is a function that returns an instance of the Celo provider for Truffle.

- `network_id`: This is the ID of the Celo network that you want to deploy your smart contract on. For the Alfajores testnet, the network ID is 42220.

- `gas`: This is the maximum amount of gas that can be used to execute the smart contract functions.

- `gasPrice`: This is the price of gas in wei that you're willing to pay for each unit of gas. In this case, we're setting it to 1 gwei.

- `timeoutBlocks`: This is the number of blocks to wait before a transaction is considered to have failed due to timeout.

- `skipDryRun`: This skips the dry run process before deploying your smart contract to the network.

Save the `truffle-config.js` file.

That's it! You have now modified the `truffle-config.js` file to be compatible with the Celo blockchain. You can now use Truffle commands to deploy your smart contract to the Celo network. For example, to deploy your smart contract to the Celo network, you can use the following command:

```js

truffle migrate --network celo

```

Congratulations on successfully deploying our Dapp project to Celo! 🎊 While it may have been a lengthy article, we made it through the first half.

## 🛠 Use Cases for Smart Contracts in DeFi on Celo

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Celo is an emerging space that offers a lot of opportunities for developers and entrepreneurs to create innovative applications that are transparent, accessible, and secure. Smart contracts, which are self-executing digital programs, are at the core of DeFi on Celo. These contracts allow for the creation of new financial products and services that can be built on top of the Celo blockchain. In this article, we'll explore some of the use cases for smart contracts in DeFi on Celo.

- ## Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

One of the most popular use cases for smart contracts in DeFi is the creation of decentralized exchanges. DEXs are trading platforms that allow users to exchange assets directly without relying on intermediaries such as centralized exchanges. Smart contracts enable DEXs to be decentralized, meaning that no central authority controls the exchange. Celo already has some decentralized exchanges like Moola and UbeSwap, which use smart contracts to execute trades, hold assets in escrow, and distribute tokens to traders.

- ## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency or commodity. They are popular in DeFi because they provide a stable store of value for traders and investors. Smart contracts are used to create and manage stablecoins, such as the cUSD and cEUR stablecoins on Celo. These stablecoins are backed by a reserve of assets held in a smart contract, which ensures that their value remains stable over time.

- ## Yield farming

Yield farming is the practice of earning a return on investment by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols. Smart contracts are used to automate the process of yield farming and distribute rewards to liquidity providers. Platforms like Ubeswap and Moola offer yield farming opportunities for liquidity providers, allowing them to earn rewards in exchange for providing liquidity to the platform.

- ## Lending and borrowing

Lending and borrowing platforms on Celo use smart contracts to create trustless and transparent systems for borrowers and lenders. These smart contracts execute the terms of the loan, such as interest rates, collateral requirements, and repayment schedules, without the need for intermediaries. The Celo network already has some lending and borrowing platforms like Valora and CeloCamp, which offer decentralized lending and borrowing opportunities.

- ## Insurance

Smart contracts are also being used to create decentralized insurance products on Celo. Insurance protocols use smart contracts to execute insurance policies automatically, ensuring that claims are paid out transparently and efficiently. These smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Examples of insurance protocols on Celo include Unslashed and SURE.
